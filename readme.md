# Battleships
 Part of the Odin Project curriculum.

## Project Overview
Inspired by the board game, the user plays a game where they must guess the location of all the computer's ships and attempt to sink all of them. The game is ended when either all the user's ships or the computer's ships are destroyed.

This project was coded in pure vanilla JavaScript while following TDD, OOP, and module design pattern.
